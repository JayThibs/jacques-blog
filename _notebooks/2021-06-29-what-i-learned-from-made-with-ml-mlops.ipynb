    "In this post, I will capture the learnings I made when going through the [Made With ML MLOps](https://madewithml.com/#mlops). I will try to add my personal twist and I will skip over the section I already feel comfortable with, so you can go directly to the [Made With ML](https://madewithml.com) if you want to learn in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "My focus will be to give the TLDR of what I personally have learned the most from the website since that will be the most beneficial for me. That doesn't mean the things I don't cover are less important. For example, understanding intuition and the objective of a project is crucial and it is something I find many people will miss. If you're not aiming for the correct objective, everything else is basically meaningless.\n",
