<h1>Interested in building AI efficiently while providing value to society?</h1> 

That is what this blog is about. I want to help others take their data science work out of some scathered notebooks and into production. Specifically, I will focus on putting models into production, training machine learning models, building end-to-end projects as efficiently as possible, and coding more effectively.
