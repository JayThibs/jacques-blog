Hi, I'm Jacques Thibodeau. My long-term goal is to create a world with less suffering and prevent any existential risks to humanity. At the highest level, my current focus is to find ways to help individuals meet their security needs, so that they may move on to meeting their growth needs, and eventually become fully transcendent beings. For a quick summary of what this means, go [here](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/transcend-the-new-science-of-self-actualization-by-scott-barry-kaufman/). Or read the book which thought me about transcendence (it's not in the woo-woo sense): [Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization](https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Self-Actualization-Scott-Barry-Kaufman-ebook/dp/B07WZ9T5TM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1624888477&sr=8-1).

On this blog, my particular focus is to improve everyone's AI skills (including my own) so that we can build solutions that make it into the real-world and provide a net benefit to society. Since not every project can be certain to have a positive impact in the long-term, I will also be donating a portion of my income to [effective charities](https://www.givewell.org/) so that I can divert the money-making potential of AI to the most good. I have nothing against making money. In fact, part of my goal here is to generate a significant amount of wealth through AI so that I can donate more to effective charities, and hopefully help others do the same.

For more details on what has most impacted my current beliefs, go to [EffectiveAltruism.org](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and read [The Pragmatist's Guide to Life](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatists-Guide-Life-Creating-Questions-ebook/dp/B079LRHPM7).
