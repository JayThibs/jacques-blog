            "title": "Experimenting with Elicit (GPT-3)",
            "content": "What This Post Is About . A few months ago, I gained access to a new exciting tool called Elicit from Ought. Elicit is an AI research assistant that helps you answer questions &quot;by making qualitative reasoning steps explicit and using language models to incrementally automate those steps.&quot; . Using GPT-3 on the backend, Elicit is able to help with a wide range of research and brainstorming tasks. The team behind Elicit are focused on building tools that will help millions of people think through the types of questions we ask ourselves every day. . You can watch Elicit screencasts on YouTube to get a sense of all the things it can do. It really is impressive. . What Excites Me About Tools Like Elicit . Recent innovations in machine learning have helped us build models which are great at dealing with labeled data tasks, but how can we use these models to answer questions where we don&#39;t have a labeled dataset and are a bit more subjective? For example, could we have an AI where we can ask it questions like &quot;How do I decide what career I should dedicate my life to?&quot; or &quot;My partner feels jealous about my career growth, what should I do?&quot; It would really be amazing if we could have an AI that could answer these questions. . I&#39;m particularly excited about how AI will help make knowledge accessible to everyone in a way that will guide humanity towards a better future. Though still in its early stages, AI has started showing signs of having the potential to revolutionize education, research, and even therapy. . One glimpse of this was in a Twitter thread where one of the employees at OpenAI said they used GPT-3 as a therapist and were able to achieve a deeper breakthrough than they had ever had with a human therapist. We&#39;re not at the point where our models can be taken out of the labs yet, but once our models become exceptional and robust, and we can make such fields unbelievably cheap, accessible, and compatible with human values, inequality of world-class services will likely change quickly. . My Initial Deep Dive into Elicit . Into Forecasting? . Elicit has a feature called Elicit Forecast which is hidden from the main website, but they go into a bit of detail about how it works here. For any aspiring superforecaster out there, this could be a great tool. . In the future, we can expect people will ask Elicit a question like, &quot;Will we be able to finish project x on time?&quot; and Elicit will give us its best guess. As time goes on, I&#39;m sure a tool like Elicit will become an invaluable tool for not just forecasters, but also people like project managers who want to get a better idea on how long a project will actually take. . Closing Thoughts . Having worked in government for the past 4 years, there&#39;s a lot of things that excite me about Elicit, things that I thought of building myself. I&#39;m glad someone is building a tool like this. . As they write on their website, I can see it being applied in government policy (Senators could become better at asking questions and could get caught up to speed on issues much more effectively than the current approach), but I can also see it working in strategic foresight teams like Horizons Canada or in regulatory bodies who have to dig into tons of PDFs to find the right information and make sure the company is compliant with the law. . I will note that one of the things I am the most excited for is creating a second brain with a tool like Elicit. Sure we can use Roam Research to connect our thoughts and we can even load tons of text in Roam Research, but I think Semantic Search with Elicit could be much more powerful by simply having it point to or answer questions we have on a certain topic after loading 100k documents on that topic. .",

I will try to add my personal twist and I will skip over the section I already feel comfortable with, so you can go directly to the Made With ML if you want to learn in more detail. . My focus will be to give the TLDR of what I personally have learned the most from the website since that will be the most beneficial for me. That doesn&#39;t mean the things I don&#39;t cover are less important. For example, understanding intuition and the objective of a project is crucial and it is something I find many people will miss. If you&#39;re not aiming for the correct objective, everything else is basically meaningless. . Anyway, without further ado, here are my notes from the MLOps course: .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

          "content": "Hi, I’m Jacques Thibodeau. My long-term goal is to create a world with less suffering and prevent any existential risks to humanity. At the highest level, my current focus is to find ways to help individuals meet their security needs, so that they may move on to meeting their growth needs, and eventually become fully transcendent beings. For a quick summary of what this means, go here. Or read the book which thought me about transcendence (it’s not in the woo-woo sense): Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization. . I think it is important for me to leave that information here as I want to remind myself that everything I do is for the betterment of humanity and all beings. . On this blog, my particular focus is to improve everyone’s AI skills (including my own) so that we can build solutions that make it into the real-world and provide a net benefit to society. Since not every project can be certain to have a positive impact in the long-term, I will also be donating a portion of my income to effective charities so that I can divert the money-making potential of AI to the most good. I have nothing against making money. In fact, part of my goal here is to generate a significant amount of wealth through AI so that I can donate more to effective charities, and hopefully help others do the same. . For more details on what has most impacted my current beliefs, go to EffectiveAltruism.org and read The Pragmatist’s Guide to Life. . The following image is that of the boats that represent human life. The bottom of the boat is necessary to prevent us from sinking. We need to meet these security needs so that our sail can guide us in the direction of growth. In the state of transcendence, human beings are striving every day towards not only their own greatest potential, but everyone elses potential. There is no more ego. . .",
