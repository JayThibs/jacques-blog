            "content": "What This Post Is About . In this post, I will capture the learnings I made when going through the Made With ML MLOps. I will try to add my personal twist and I will skip over the section I already feel comfortable with, so you can go directly to the Made With ML if you want to learn in more detail. . My focus will be to give the TLDR of what I personally have learned the most from the website since that will be the most beneficial for me. That doesn&#39;t mean the things I don&#39;t cover are less important. For example, understanding intuition and the objective of a project is crucial and it is something I find many people will miss. If you&#39;re not aiming for the correct objective, everything else is basically meaningless. . Anyway, without further ado, here are my notes from the MLOps course: . This is my first blog post on my website! Victory! . . And more to come! .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

          "content": "Hi, I’m Jacques Thibodeau. My long-term goal is to create a world with less suffering and prevent any existential risks to humanity. At the highest level, my current focus is to find ways to help individuals meet their security needs, so that they may move on to meeting their growth needs, and eventually become fully transcendent beings. For a quick summary of what this means, go here. Or read the book which thought me about transcendence (it’s not in the woo-woo sense): Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization. . I think it is important for me to leave that information here as I want to remind myself that everything I do is for the betterment of humanity and all beings. . On this blog, my particular focus is to improve everyone’s AI skills (including my own) so that we can build solutions that make it into the real-world and provide a net benefit to society. Since not every project can be certain to have a positive impact in the long-term, I will also be donating a portion of my income to effective charities so that I can divert the money-making potential of AI to the most good. I have nothing against making money. In fact, part of my goal here is to generate a significant amount of wealth through AI so that I can donate more to effective charities, and hopefully help others do the same. . For more details on what has most impacted my current beliefs, go to EffectiveAltruism.org and read The Pragmatist’s Guide to Life. . The following image is that of the boats that represent human life. The bottom of the boat is necessary to prevent us from sinking. We need to meet these security needs so that our sail can guide us in the direction of growth. In the state of transcendence, human beings are striving every day towards not only their own greatest potential, but everyone elses potential. There is no more ego. . .",
